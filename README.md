# HyprInstall
This is a fork of the V4 of the Hyprland install script made by SolDoesTech.

It contains a simple install script to streamline the installation of Hyprland on Arch Linux.
IMPORTANT - This script is meant to run on a clean fresh Arch install on physical hardware

If you're planning to run this script make sure you read it first to understand what it does.

Note that the dotfiles will be managed by stow, so if you remove it from the dependencies the script will not work unless you modify it accordingly.

Feel free to fork and modify the script to your liking.
